-- List of useful functions:

    ignore = right = snd -> return the value of the second expression
    print -> Prints x to stdout, returns x.
    me -> An integer which represents the current process id.
    rep -> unwraps an integer into its lambda equivalent (kinda like a for loop)
    lt, gt, leq, geq, eq -> check if first number is <,>,<=,>=,== to the second.
    dec, inc -> --,++ an integer.
    add, sub, max, min, mul, exp -> maths
    id -> returns x.
    merge -> sync two spawns and combine with a function.
    comm -> Wrap a spawn with a channel pass and return the channel
    ret -> Wrap a comm in a swap call.

-- returns the second thing passed (aka false)
snd a b = b
-- Spawns process f, and returns the channel C with which it passed to it.
comm = (fun f. ((fun c. snd (spawn (f c)) c) newchan))
ret = swap (comm f) 0
-- spawn two expressions and then merge the first thing recved on their channels
merge = (fun f. (fun a. (fun b. f (swap (comm a) 0) (swap (comm b) 0))))
